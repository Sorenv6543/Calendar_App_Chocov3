Can you help me push my files to a GitHub repository

Let me help you push your files to a GitHub repository. First, I'll check if your project is already initialized with Git:

<details>
            <summary>Listed current directory • **14** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📁 `.git` |
| 📄 `package-lock.json` |
| 📁 `node_modules` |
| 📄 `package.json` |
| 📄 `vite.config.js` |
| 📁 `.cursor` |
| 📁 `src` |
| 📁 `public` |
| 📁 `.vscode` |
| 📁 `.roo` |
| 📄 `ss.png` |
| 📄 `.eslintrc.js` |
| 📄 `.gitignore` |
| 📄 `index.html` |

</details>

I see your project is already initialized with Git (there's a .git directory and a .gitignore file). Here are the steps to push to GitHub:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name your repository (e.g., "Calendar_App_Chocov3")
   - Choose public or private visibility
   - Don't initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
   - Click "Create repository"

2. Add your remote repository (in your terminal):
   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Calendar_App_Chocov3.git
   ```

3. Stage your changes:
   ```
   git add .
   ```

4. Commit your changes:
   ```
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

5. Push to GitHub:
   ```
   git push -u origin main
   ```

If your default branch is named differently (like "master"), use that instead of "main" in the push command.

If you're prompted for GitHub credentials, you may need to authenticate using a personal access token instead of your password. Would you like me to explain how to create one?

I see you're encountering an error when trying to rename your branch to "main". This suggests there might be an issue with your Git repository. Let's fix this by reinitializing Git:

1. First, back up any important uncommitted changes

2. Remove the existing Git repository:
   ```
   rm -rf .git
   ```
   (On Windows CMD use: `rmdir /s /q .git`)

3. Initialize a new Git repository:
   ```
   git init
   ```

4. Add your files:
   ```
   git add .
   ```

5. Make your initial commit:
   ```
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

6. Create and switch to main branch:
   ```
   git branch -M main
   ```

7. Add your GitHub repository as remote:
   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Calendar_App_Chocov3.git
   ```

8. Push to GitHub:
   ```
   git push -u origin main
   ```

This should resolve the Git reference issue you were experiencing.

Those line ending warnings are normal on Windows systems and won't affect your repository. They just indicate Git will convert Unix-style line endings (LF) to Windows-style (CRLF).

Continue with the next steps:

1. Make your initial commit:
   ```
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

2. Set up the main branch:
   ```
   git branch -M main
   ```

3. Add your GitHub repository URL (replace with your actual username):
   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Calendar_App_Chocov3.git
   ```

4. Push to GitHub:
   ```
   git push -u origin main
   ```

If you want to prevent these line ending warnings in the future, you can set:
```
git config --global core.autocrlf true
```
