# Fixing Value Acceptance Error in Code (2025-04-24 16:46:41)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Value is not accepted. Valid values: "always", "hover".
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

The error is occurring with the `scm.diffDecorationsGutterVisibility` setting. The current value "none" is invalid - only "always" or "hover" are accepted values.

---

```diff
    "files.autoSave": "afterDelay",
    "files.autoSaveDelay": 1000,
-   "scm.diffDecorationsGutterVisibility": "none",
+   "scm.diffDecorationsGutterVisibility": "hover",
    "workbench.editor.enablePreview": true,
    "workbench.editor.closeOnFileDelete": true,
```

---

Changed `scm.diffDecorationsGutterVisibility` from "none" to "hover". This setting controls when source control diff indicators appear in the editor gutter - now they'll only show when you hover over lines.
