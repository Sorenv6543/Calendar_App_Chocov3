# Rendering Behavior in DevTools Performance Tab (2025-04-25 01:23:23)

_**User**_

from devtools performace tab . is it normal for the same thing to be renderd like that within seconds?

---

_**Assistant**_

Looking at your performance tab, this pattern of frequent renders for the same components typically indicates one of these issues:

1. Reactive dependency changes triggering multiple renders
2. Missing key optimizations in v-for loops
3. Props or reactive state changing too frequently
4. Event handlers causing cascading updates

Let me check your codebase to provide specific recommendations:

Let's look at the Vue application structure:

---

            <summary>Listed directory src • **14** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📁 `components` |
| 📄 `user-utils.ts` |

| 📁 `composables` |
| 📁 `assets` |
| 📄 `App.vue` |
| 📄 `auth.js` |
| 📄 `firebaseConfig.js` |

</details>

---

Let's look at the main App.vue which likely contains the components we see in the performance tab:

---

Read file: src/App.vue

---

Let's check the main layout components as that's where most of the components from your performance trace would be used:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory src/components • **14** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `Home.vue` |
| 📄 `NavigationBar.vue` |
| 📄 `HouseModal.vue` |
| 📄 `FullCalendar.vue` |
| 📄 `EventEditModal.vue` |
| 📄 `EventModal.vue` |
| 📄 `Playground.vue` |
| 📄 `HouseList.bak` |
| 📄 `Sidebar1.bak` |
| 📄 `Userprofile.vue` |
| 📄 `Register.vue` |
| 📄 `Login.vue` |
| 📄 `Playground2.vue` |
| 📄 `TimePicker.vue` |

</details>

---

Based on the performance trace and what I'm seeing in your codebase, the frequent renders are likely due to one of these common issues:

1. **Reactive cascading updates**: When parent components update, they can trigger re-renders of child components.

2. **Missing memoization**: Vue components should use `computed` properties or `useMemo` (from VueUse) for expensive calculations.

3. **Prop drilling**: Passing down props through multiple component levels can create a re-render cascade.

To optimize performance:

1. Use `defineAsyncComponent` with `Suspense` for components that don't need to render immediately.

2. Add `v-memo` directive to optimize list rendering:
   ```vue
   <v-btn v-for="item in items" :key="item.id" v-memo="[item.id, item.selected]">
   ```

3. Implement `shallowRef` for large objects that don't need deep reactivity.

4. Check for event handlers that might be causing state updates in rapid succession.

This pattern isn't necessarily problematic if your app feels responsive, but optimizing these renders can improve performance and battery life on mobile devices.

---

_**User**_

could you give me some examples based on my code base?

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Let me examine your specific components to provide targeted optimization examples:

---

Read file: src/components/NavigationBar.vue

---

Read file: src/components/NavigationBar.vue

---

Read file: src/components/FullCalendar.vue

---

Read file: src/stores/userStore.ts

---

Based on your code, here are specific optimizations to fix the frequent render issues shown in your performance tab:

### 1. Memoize Reactive Computations in NavigationBar.vue

```vue
<script setup>
// Current implementation
const userInitials = computed(() => {
    return user.value.name
        .split(' ')
        .map(name => name[0])
        .join('');
});

// Optimized version with v-memo
</script>

<template>
  <!-- Add v-memo to components that re-render frequently -->
  <v-avatar size="56" color="primary" class="elevation-2 mb-2" v-if="!rail || isMobile" v-memo="[userInitials]">
    <span class="text-h6 font-weight-medium">{{ userInitials }}</span>
  </v-avatar>
</template>
```

### 2. Reduce Cascading Updates in NavigationBar.vue

```vue
<script setup>
import { shallowRef } from 'vue';

// Replace standard ref with shallowRef for complex objects
const displayedHouses = computed(() => {
    // Get houses directly from userStore
    const houses = userStore.userData?.houses || [];
    
    // Return a new array without causing deep reactivity
    return houses.map(house => ({
        ...house,
        selected: typeof house.selected === 'boolean' ? house.selected : true
    }));
});

// Debounce house selection changes
const toggleHouseSelection = debounce((house) => {
    house.selected = !house.selected;
    emit('toggle-house', house);
}, 100);
</script>
```

### 3. Optimize VBtn Rendering in Navigation Components

```vue
<template>
  <!-- Add v-memo to your repeated buttons to prevent unnecessary re-renders -->
  <v-btn-group variant="outlined" divided class="w-100 view-btn-group d-flex justify-center">
    <v-btn v-for="view in viewOptions" :key="view.value" 
           :value="view.value"
           :active="currentView === view.value" 
           @click="currentView = view.value" 
           class="flex-1 view-btn"
           v-memo="[view.value, currentView === view.value]">
      {{ view.label }}
    </v-btn>
  </v-btn-group>
</template>
```

### 4. Optimize FullCalendar.vue Event Rendering

```vue
<script setup>
import { useMemo } from '@vueuse/core';
import debounce from 'lodash/debounce';

// Debounce the refreshTurnDayHighlights function
const debouncedRefreshHighlights = debounce(() => {
  refreshTurnDayHighlights();
}, 200);

// Optimize fetch events with memoization
const optimizedFetchEvents = useMemo(
  () => fetchEvents,
  // Only recompute when these dependencies change
  [() => props.userId, () => props.selectedHouseId]
);

// Use in calendarOptions
const calendarOptions = {
  // Other options...
  events: optimizedFetchEvents,
};
</script>
```

### 5. Optimize VDefaultsProvider Rendering

In your userStore, optimize the watch functionality to prevent cascading updates:

```typescript
// In userStore.ts
import { isEqual } from 'lodash';

// Replace this action
async fetchUserData(currentUser) {
  this.isLoading = true;
  this.error = null;
  try {
    const unsubscribe = await fetchUserData(currentUser, this);
    this.unsubscribeUser = unsubscribe;

    // Compare data before updating
    if (this.userData && Array.isArray(this.userData.houses) && 
        !isEqual(this.userData.houses, sortedHouses)) {
      this.userData.houses = sortedHouses;
    }
  } catch (err: any) {
    this.error = "Failed to load user data: " + err.message;
  } finally {
    this.isLoading = false;
  }
}
```

### 6. Implement Dynamic Component Loading

```vue
<script setup>
import { defineAsyncComponent } from 'vue';

// Dynamically load components for better performance
const EventModal = defineAsyncComponent(() => 
  import('./EventModal.vue')
);
</script>

<template>
  <Suspense>
    <EventModal v-if="isEventModalVisible" />
    <template #fallback>
      <v-skeleton-loader type="card" />
    </template>
  </Suspense>
</template>
```

This pattern of re-renders is common in Vue/Vuetify apps. It's caused by the cascading reactive updates when parent components update and cause children to re-render. The optimizations above will significantly reduce unnecessary re-renders by:

1. Using v-memo on frequently updated components
2. Implementing shallow reactivity for complex objects
3. Debouncing frequently triggered events
4. Using async component loading with Suspense
5. Implementing proper equality checks before updating state

These changes should reduce the number of repeat renders shown in your performance tab while maintaining your application's functionality.

Debouncing frequently triggered events...can you explain what this means?

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Debouncing is a programming technique that limits how often a function can be executed. It works by:

1. Postponing execution until after a specified delay (in milliseconds)
2. Resetting this delay timer if the function is called again before the timer expires
3. Only executing the function once after the specified delay has passed without additional calls

For example, in your code:

```typescript
// Without debouncing
const toggleHouseSelection = (house) => {
  house.selected = !house.selected;
  emit('toggle-house', house);
};

// With debouncing (using lodash)
import debounce from 'lodash/debounce';

const toggleHouseSelection = debounce((house) => {
  house.selected = !house.selected;
  emit('toggle-house', house);
}, 100); // 100ms delay
```

This is particularly useful for:

1. **Event handlers that trigger expensive operations**: When a user rapidly clicks a button or toggles selections, debouncing prevents multiple state updates and re-renders.

2. **Search inputs**: Rather than triggering a search on every keystroke, debouncing waits until the user pauses typing.

3. **Window resize handlers**: Instead of recalculating layouts on every pixel change, debounce to run once after resizing stops.

4. **Scroll events**: These fire extremely frequently, so debouncing helps limit performance impact.

In your calendar app, debouncing helps with:
- Preventing multiple event selections when users double-click
- Limiting frequency of date/view changes
- Reducing unnecessary re-renders when houses are toggled quickly

This significantly improves performance by batching updates together rather than processing each event individually, which directly addresses the repeated rendering issue you're seeing in your performance tab.

For the code present, we get this error:
```
'auth.currentUser' is possibly 'null'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.  and what would be the purpose of fixing the typescript error in the general context?

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Add a null check or use optional chaining for `auth.currentUser`:

```typescript
id: auth.currentUser?.uid || currentUser.uid,
```

This fix:
1. Uses optional chaining (`?.`) to safely access `uid` when `currentUser` exists
2. Falls back to `currentUser.uid` when `auth.currentUser` is null
3. Prevents potential runtime errors if `auth.currentUser` is null

Fixing this TypeScript error ensures your application won't crash at runtime if the authentication state changes unexpectedly. It's a good practice that improves code reliability by handling edge cases that TypeScript identifies during compilation.

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Could not find name 'currentUser'. Did you mean 'getCurrentUser'?
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Replace the getCurrentUser function with:

```javascript
export const getCurrentUser = () => {
  return auth.currentUser?.uid || null;
};
```

This removes the reference to undefined `currentUser` variable and returns `null` when no user is authenticated, which is the appropriate value for representing "no user" in this context.

---

_**User**_

it looks like there already is a fallback to null

---

_**Assistant**_



---

You're right about the `getCurrentUser()` function - it has the proper fallback to null. 

However, the TypeScript error is coming from `user-utils.ts` where you're directly accessing `auth.currentUser.uid` in three places without optional chaining:

```typescript
id: auth.currentUser.uid,  // Lines 42, 52, and 69
```

Fix each instance by adding optional chaining and using currentUser's uid as fallback:

```typescript
id: auth.currentUser?.uid || currentUser.uid,
```

This protects against null reference errors if auth state changes during execution.

_**Assistant**_

To resolve this error, install the missing type definitions by running:

```sh
npm install --save-dev @types/node
```

This will provide the required type definitions for Node.js, and the error will be resolved.
