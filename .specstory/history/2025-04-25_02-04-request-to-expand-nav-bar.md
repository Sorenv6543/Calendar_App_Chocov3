# Request to Expand NAV Bar (2025-04-24 19:04:21)

_**User**_

Can you expand the NAV bar semi-permanently? Thank you

Looking at your code, I'll modify the `Home.vue` file to make the navigation bar semi-permanently expanded by default.

---

```diff
  const showSidebar = ref(false);
  const isMobileView = ref(window.innerWidth <= 768);
- const sidebarPersistent = ref(false);
+ const sidebarPersistent = ref(true);
  const showHouseModal = ref(false);
  const showEventModal = ref(false);
```

---

The navigation bar is now set to remain expanded by default. I've changed the `sidebarPersistent` initial value to `true` in Home.vue.

This change means:
- The sidebar won't collapse when your mouse leaves it
- The expanded state will persist across interactions with the app
- You'll still be able to manually collapse it using the button in the sidebar

If you need to adjust this behavior further, let me know!
