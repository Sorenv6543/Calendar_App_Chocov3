# FullCalendar.vue Component Documentation

## Overview
Vue 3 component wrapping FullCalendar library to display and manage event data with Firebase integration. Supports month/week/day views, event CRUD operations, turn day highlighting, and drag-and-drop functionality.

## Props
- `userId`: String (required) - User identifier for event filtering
- `selectedHouseId`: String - Currently selected house ID
- `view`: String - Calendar view type ('month', 'week', 'day')

## Key Features

### Calendar Navigation
```654:684:src/components/FullCalendar.vue
:deep(.fc-daygrid-event-harness) {
  /* Add color-related styling if needed, or remove this ruleset */
  color: inherit; /* Example placeholder */
}
```

### Event Management
- Create: Date selection opens EventModal for new event creation
- Edit: Click events to modify details
- Delete: Remove events with confirmation
- Resize: Drag event edges to adjust duration
- Drag-and-drop: Reposition events by dragging

### Turn Day Highlighting
Visually marks days with turnover events using custom CSS classes.

## Firebase Integration
Events are stored in Firestore with CRUD operations:
- `fetchEvents`: Retrieves events filtered by user ID
- `handleCreateEvent`: Adds new events to Firestore
- `handleEventUpdate`: Updates existing events
- `deleteEvent`: Removes events from database

## Performance Optimizations
- Debounced refresh functions
- Disabled transitions/animations
- Content visibility optimizations
- Batched DOM operations
- Hardware acceleration disabled

## Responsive Design
Adapts to different screen sizes with mobile-specific styling for navigation and layout.

## Event Styling
Events use custom styling with color properties extracted from event data:
```651:657:src/components/FullCalendar.vue
:deep(.fc-event-main) {
  /* Keep only color-related styling */
  color: white !important;
}
```

## Custom Components
- EventModal: Form for creating/editing events
- TimePicker: Time selection for check-in/out times
