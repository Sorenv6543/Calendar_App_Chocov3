Let me find and update the sidebar components to implement a ribbon-like design with arrows at the ends.

Let's look at the components directory:

Found it! Let's examine the Sidebar.vue component:

---

Read file: src/components/Sidebar.vue

---

Now let's check the App.vue file to look for the toggle button:

---

Read file: src/App.vue

---

Let's look at the Home.vue component since it might contain the toggle button for the sidebar:

---

Read file: src/components/Home.vue

---

Perfect! I found both the sidebar and toggle button styles in Home.vue. I need to modify them to create ribbon-like designs with arrows at the ends. Let's update the styles:

---

```diff
    height: 40px;
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(65, 105, 226, 0.75) 0%, rgba(102, 187, 106, 0.75) 100%);
-   border-radius: 12px;
    box-shadow: 0 4px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
    cursor: pointer;
```

```diff
    will-change: transform, left;
    animation: togglePulse 2s infinite;
-   clip-path: polygon(0% 0%, 100% 0%, 85% 50%, 100% 100%, 0% 100%, 15% 50%);
+   clip-path: polygon(0% 0%, 75% 0%, 100% 50%, 75% 100%, 0% 100%, 15% 50%);
    backdrop-filter: blur(4px);
  }
```

```diff
    animation: movedTogglePulse 2s infinite;
    box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
-   clip-path: polygon(15% 0%, 85% 0%, 100% 50%, 85% 100%, 15% 100%, 0% 50%);
+   clip-path: polygon(15% 0%, 100% 0%, 85% 50%, 100% 100%, 15% 100%, 0% 50%);
    background-size: 200% 200%;
  }
```

---

Now let's update the mobile styles for the toggle button to keep the ribbon design consistent:

---

```diff
      background-size: 200% 200%;
      background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(65, 105, 226, 0.75) 0%, rgba(102, 187, 106, 0.75) 100%);
+     clip-path: polygon(0% 0%, 75% 0%, 100% 50%, 75% 100%, 0% 100%, 15% 50%);
    }
  
```

```diff
      top: 120px;
      background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(102, 187, 106, 0.75) 0%, rgba(65, 105, 226, 0.75) 100%);
-     clip-path: polygon(15% 0%, 85% 0%, 100% 50%, 85% 100%, 15% 100%, 0% 50%);
+     clip-path: polygon(15% 0%, 100% 0%, 85% 50%, 100% 100%, 15% 100%, 0% 50%);
      background-size: 200% 200%;
    }
```

---

Now let's update the sidebar itself to give it a ribbon-like appearance with an arrow at the end:

---

```diff
    font-family: 'Roboto', 'Arial', sans-serif;
    font-weight: normal;
-   border-right: 3px solid rgba(65, 105, 226, 0.6);
+   border-right: none;
    overflow-y: auto;
    position: fixed;
```

```diff
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
-   border-top-left-radius: 10px;
-   border-bottom-left-radius: 10px;
+   border-top-left-radius: 0;
+   border-bottom-left-radius: 0;
    transition: left 0.3s ease, box-shadow 0.3s ease, transform 0.3s ease;
    z-index: 20;
    box-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
    backdrop-filter: blur(8px);
+   /* Add ribbon-like shape with arrow at the bottom */
+   clip-path: polygon(
+     0% 0%,
+     100% 0%,
+     100% 80%, 
+     100% 95%,
+     85% 100%,
+     0% 100%
+   );
  }
  
```

```diff
      transform: scale(1);
      box-shadow: 0 0 15px rgba(65, 105, 226, 0.4);
-     border-right: 3px solid var(--primary-color);
+     border-right: none;
    }
  
    50% {
      transform: scale(1.01);
      box-shadow: 0 0 25px rgba(65, 105, 226, 0.7);
-     border-right: 3px solid var(--success-color);
+     border-right: none;
    }
  
    100% {
      transform: scale(1);
      box-shadow: 0 0 15px rgba(65, 105, 226, 0.4);
-     border-right: 3px solid var(--primary-color);
+     border-right: none;
    }
  }
```

---

Now let's update the mobile view of the sidebar to maintain the ribbon-like shape:

---

```diff
      margin-top: 0;
      /* No margin on mobile */
-     border-radius: 0;
-     /* Already flat, just to be explicit */
+     /* Keep the ribbon-like shape with arrow at the bottom */
+     clip-path: polygon(
+       0% 0%,
+       100% 0%,
+       100% 85%, 
+       100% 95%,
+       85% 100%,
+       0% 100%
+     );
    }
  
    .sidebar.mobile-view .sidebar-logo {
      border-radius: 0;
      height: 60px;
-     /* Already flat, just to be explicit */
    }
  }
```

---

Let's enhance the ribbon effect by adding a decorative element at the "arrow" part of the sidebar and a subtle gradient to make it more ribbon-like:

---

```diff
    width: 310px;
    height: calc(100% - 15px);
-   background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.75);
+   background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.85) 0%, rgba(240, 240, 255, 0.85) 100%);
    font-family: 'Roboto', 'Arial', sans-serif;
    font-weight: normal;
```

```diff
    box-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
    backdrop-filter: blur(8px);
-   /* Add ribbon-like shape with arrow at the bottom */
-   clip-path: polygon(0% 0%,
+   /* Ribbon-like shape with arrow at the bottom */
+   clip-path: polygon(
+     0% 0%,
      100% 0%,
      100% 80%, 
      100% 95%,
      85% 100%,
-       0% 100%);
+     0% 100%
+   );
+ }
+ 
+ /* Add decorative arrow element */
+ .sidebar::after {
+   content: '';
+   position: absolute;
+   right: 0;
+   bottom: 5%;
+   width: 15%;
+   height: 15%;
+   background: linear-gradient(135deg, var(--primary-color) 0%, var(--success-color) 100%);
+   clip-path: polygon(0 0, 100% 0, 50% 100%);
+   opacity: 0.8;
+   animation: arrowGlow 2s infinite alternate;
+   z-index: -1;
+ }
+ 
+ @keyframes arrowGlow {
+   0% {
+     opacity: 0.6;
+     transform: translateY(0);
+   }
+   100% {
+     opacity: 0.9;
+     transform: translateY(-3px);
+   }
  }
  
```

---

Let's also adjust the toggle button to enhance its ribbon-like appearance with additional decorative elements:

---

```diff
    backdrop-filter: blur(4px);
  }
+ 
+ /* Add decorative pseudo-element for ribbon look */
+ .sidebar-toggle::before {
+   content: '';
+   position: absolute;
+   inset: 3px;
+   background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(65, 105, 226, 0.5) 0%, rgba(102, 187, 106, 0.5) 100%);
+   clip-path: polygon(5% 5%, 75% 5%, 95% 50%, 75% 95%, 5% 95%, 18% 50%);
+   z-index: -1;
+   opacity: 0.7;
+   animation: innerGlow 2s infinite alternate;
+ }
+ 
+ @keyframes innerGlow {
+   0% { opacity: 0.5; }
+   100% { opacity: 0.9; }
+ }
  
  @keyframes togglePulse {
```

---

Let's also update the mobile toggle style to match:

---

```diff
      clip-path: polygon(0% 0%, 75% 0%, 100% 50%, 75% 100%, 0% 100%, 15% 50%);
    }
+ 
+   /* Update pseudo-element for mobile */
+   .sidebar-toggle::before {
+     clip-path: polygon(5% 5%, 75% 5%, 95% 50%, 75% 95%, 5% 95%, 18% 50%);
+   }
  
    @keyframes togglePulseMobile {
```

---

Let's update the mobile view of the sidebar to ensure the decorative arrow element is properly positioned:

---

```diff
      /* Use full height on mobile */
      margin-top: 0;
-     /* No margin on mobile */
      /* Keep the ribbon-like shape with arrow at the bottom */
-     clip-path: polygon(0% 0%,
+     clip-path: polygon(
+       0% 0%,
        100% 0%,
        100% 85%, 
        100% 95%,
        85% 100%,
-         0% 100%);
+       0% 100%
+     );
+   }
+ 
+   /* Reposition the decorative arrow for mobile */
+   .sidebar.mobile-view.show::after {
+     bottom: 2%;
+     right: 0;
+     width: 10%;
+     height: 10%;
    }
  
```

The ribbon-style designs with arrows at the ends have been implemented for both the sidebar and toggle button. Here's a summary of the changes:

1. For the sidebar:
   - Added a ribbon-like shape with an arrow at the bottom using clip-path
   - Applied a gradient background for a more ribbon-like appearance
   - Added a decorative arrow element using a pseudo-element with animation
   - Adjusted the mobile view to maintain the ribbon shape

2. For the toggle button:
   - Redesigned the shape to look more like a ribbon with an arrow using clip-path
   - Added an inner decorative element for enhanced depth
   - Created animations for a subtle glowing effect
   - Updated both normal and moved states to maintain the ribbon appearance
   - Ensured mobile views remain consistent with the design

The result is a modern, ribbon-like UI for both the sidebar and toggle button with arrows at the ends, just as requested.

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Unknown property: 'elevation'
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

---

```diff
  <template>
-   <v-card class="sidebar" style="border-radius: 12px; elevation: 10;">
+   <v-card class="sidebar" elevation="10" style="border-radius: 12px;">
  
      <div class="sidebar-logo">
```

---

The error was caused by incorrectly putting "elevation" in the style attribute. In Vuetify, elevation should be passed as a component prop, not as CSS. The fix moves it out of the style attribute and makes it a proper prop on the v-card component.

I notice you've made several styling updates to the sidebar:

1. Removed the border-radius style from the main v-card
2. Added elevation and border-radius to the modal card
3. Made the sidebar background more transparent
4. Added a subtle border
5. Removed the decorative arrow element

These changes look good. The elevation prop is now properly applied to both cards. Is there anything specific you'd like me to help with next?
