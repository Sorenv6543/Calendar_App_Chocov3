Let me search through the codebase to find information about account-related functionality and username editing.

            <summary>Searched codebase "edit username account information" • **0** results</summary>
        
No results found

Let me try another search focusing specifically on user-related API endpoints or services.

<details>
            <summary>Searched codebase "user profile API endpoint update username" • **0** results</summary>
        
No results found

I apologize, but I'm unable to find specific information about the command to edit username in the account information in the current codebase. This could mean either:

1. The functionality might not be implemented yet in the codebase
2. The feature might be handled through a different system or service
3. The relevant code might be in a different location or format than what I've searched for

Could you please provide more context about:
1. Where you typically access your account information (is it through a specific page or component)?
2. Are you looking for an API endpoint, a UI interaction, or something else specifically?
3. Is this part of a specific service or system you're using?

This will help me give you more accurate information about how to edit your username.
