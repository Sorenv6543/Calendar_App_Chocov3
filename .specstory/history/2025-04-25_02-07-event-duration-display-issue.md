# Event Duration Display Issue (2025-04-24 19:07:08)

When I create a new event through the event model and pick a check out date when they created event is displayed on the calendar it only displays for one day,

Looking at the code, I've identified the issue. In your EventModal.vue when creating an event, you're correctly setting:

```javascript
start: `${eventStartDate.value}T00:00:00`,
end: `${eventEndDate.value}T23:59:59`,
```

However, FullCalendar has a specific way of handling event end dates - it uses an **exclusive** end date model. This means the end date isn't included in the event display.

Here's how to fix it:

---

```diff
      }
    }
+ 
+   // Add one day to end date to make it exclusive (required by FullCalendar)
+   const endDate = new Date(eventEndDate.value);
+   endDate.setDate(endDate.getDate() + 1);
+   const exclusiveEndDate = endDate.toISOString().split('T')[0];
  
    // Create event object
    const eventData = {
      title: selectedHouse.value.address,
      start: `${eventStartDate.value}T00:00:00`,
-     end: `${eventEndDate.value}T23:59:59`,
+     end: `${exclusiveEndDate}T00:00:00`, // Use exclusive end date for proper multi-day rendering
      allDay: true,
      address: selectedHouse.value.address,
```

This fixes the issue with your calendar events only showing for one day. FullCalendar uses an "exclusive end date" model, meaning the end date you provide isn't included in the event display.

I've modified the `saveEvent` function to:

1. Create a new date object from your selected end date
2. Add one day to that date to make it exclusive
3. Format it properly for FullCalendar
4. Set the time to 00:00:00 instead of 23:59:59

With this change, when you select April 16-18 for your event, it will properly show on all three days in the calendar. The event will end at midnight on April 19 (which visually appears as ending on April 18).
