Could you please clarify what you're looking for? Your message "gg" is too brief for me to understand how I can help you with your Calendar App project.

How long do these tests take

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Without running the tests myself, I can't tell you exactly how long they take in your project. Test execution time depends on:

1. Number of test files
2. Complexity of the tests
3. Your machine's performance

To measure the execution time:

```
time npm test
```

Or add timing to your test script in package.json:

```json
"test:time": "time vitest run"
```

Vitest is generally faster than Jest, especially for Vue projects. Using Happy DOM (which I see in your dependencies) is also faster than JSDOM for browser environment simulation.

Typically, for a Vue 3 project like yours with Vitest and Happy DOM:

- Small projects (10-20 tests): 1-3 seconds
- Medium projects (50-100 tests): 5-15 seconds
- Larger projects (100+ tests): 15-60+ seconds

Vitest is generally 10-20x faster than Jest due to its Vite integration and HMR capabilities. The happy-dom environment you're using is also faster than JSDOM alternatives.

Your test:watch script provides instant feedback during development, making the testing experience feel much faster overall.

You're encountering a build error with the `analyze` command related to FullCalendar dependencies. The error occurs because Rollup can't properly resolve the import from `@fullcalendar/core/index.js`.

To fix this, you need to modify your `vite.config.js` to explicitly mark the FullCalendar modules as external:

```js
export default defineConfig({
  // existing config...
  build: {
    rollupOptions: {
      external: [
        '@fullcalendar/core',
        '@fullcalendar/core/index.js'
      ]
    }
  }
})
```

This will prevent Rollup from trying to bundle these modules and instead treat them as external dependencies, which should resolve the build error.

You're missing the `@fullcalendar/core` package, which is required by the other FullCalendar packages. To fix these errors:

1. Install the missing core package:

```
npm install @fullcalendar/core
```

2. Add externals configuration to your vite.config.js file:

---

<details>
            <summary>Searched codebase "vite.config" • **2** results</summary>
        
| File |
|------|
| `undefined` |
| `undefined` |

</details>

---

Read file: vite.config.js

---

```diff
      // Chunk splitting for better caching:
      rollupOptions: {
+       external: [
+         '@fullcalendar/core',
+         '@fullcalendar/core/index.js',
+         '@fullcalendar/core/internal.js',
+         '@fullcalendar/core/internal',
+         '@fullcalendar/core/preact.js'
+       ],
        output: {
          manualChunks: {
```

---

Now run:

```
npm install @fullcalendar/core
npm run dev
```

This fixes the issue by:

1. Installing the missing @fullcalendar/core package that's required by the other FullCalendar packages
2. Configuring Vite to treat these problematic imports as external, which prevents it from trying to bundle them

The combination of these changes should resolve the import errors you're seeing when running the development server.

You're encountering a dependency conflict. @pinia/testing v1.0.1 requires Pinia v3.0.2 or higher, but you have Pinia v2.3.1 installed.

Try installing with the legacy peer deps flag:

```
npm install @fullcalendar/core --legacy-peer-deps
```

Alternatively, you can update your dependencies by:

1. Updating Pinia to v3:
```
npm install pinia@^3.0.2 --legacy-peer-deps
```

2. Or downgrading @pinia/testing to a version compatible with Pinia v2:
```
npm install @pinia/testing@0.1.2 --legacy-peer-deps
```

The first option (using --legacy-peer-deps) is the quickest solution to get your development environment working without making major changes to your dependencies.

The test execution times look good:
- Test suite completes in 1.5-1.6 seconds
- Actual test execution is only 93ms
- Most time is spent on environment setup (~1s)

This performance is typical for a Vue 3 project with Vitest and a small test suite (6 tests). The watch mode is also working correctly, providing quick feedback as you make changes.

_**Assistant**_

To install the coverage package with the dependency conflict, use:

```
npm install -D @vitest/coverage-v8 --legacy-peer-deps
```

This is the same dependency conflict we saw earlier between:
- @pinia/testing@1.0.1 (requires pinia ≥3.0.2)
- Your current pinia@2.3.1

To fix this permanently, you can either:

1. Update pinia: `npm install pinia@^3.0.2 --legacy-peer-deps`
2. Downgrade @pinia/testing: `npm install @pinia/testing@0.1.2 --save-dev`

Option 1 is generally better as it keeps you on newer versions, but might require code changes if there are breaking changes between Pinia v2 and v3.

Your test coverage is very low at 3.63% overall. Only a few files have decent coverage:

- firebaseConfig.js: 100%
- Login.vue: 84.61%
- auth.js: 68%

Most of your codebase has 0% coverage, including key components like FullCalendar.vue, EventModal.vue, and all your composables.

To improve coverage:

1. Focus on critical components first (FullCalendar, EventModal)
2. Add tests for your stores (userStore is only 26.28% covered)
3. Write unit tests for your composables (useTimeManagement.js)

Consider setting up a coverage threshold in your vitest.config.js to gradually improve:

```js
// vitest.config.js
export default {
  test: {
    coverage: {
      thresholds: {
        lines: 20, // Start low and increase over time
        functions: 20,
        branches: 40,
        statements: 20
      }
    }
  }
}
```
