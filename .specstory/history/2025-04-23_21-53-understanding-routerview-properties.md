# RouterView Component Properties Explained

## Props
- **name: default** - The named view this RouterView should render. When you have multiple `<RouterView>` components, you can target specific ones with names. "default" is used when no name is specified.
- **route: undefined** - Optional prop to override the route used for rendering. When undefined, it uses the current route.

## Computed Properties
- **$vuetify: Reactive** - Reference to the Vuetify instance if you're using Vuetify in your project.

## Provided Values (for child components)
- **Symbol(router view depth)** - Tracks nesting level of router views for nested routes.
- **Symbol(router view location matched)** - Contains the matched route records for the current route.
- **Symbol(router view location)** - The current route location object with path, params, query, etc.

## Routing
- **$route: "/home"** - The current active route is "/home".

## RouterView Features and Tools

1. **Dynamic Components** - Renders the component matched by the current route.

2. **Nested Routes** - Supports parent/child route relationships.

3. **Named Views** - Allows multiple views on the same route (sidebar, main, etc.).

4. **Transitions** - Can wrap views in transition components:
```html
<Transition name="fade">
  <RouterView />
</Transition>
```

5. **Layouts** - Supports layout components via the `v-slot` API:
```html
<RouterView v-slot="{ Component }">
  <template v-if="Component">
    <AppLayout>
      <component :is="Component" />
    </AppLayout>
  </template>
</RouterView>
```

6. **Keeping Alive** - Caches components for better performance:
```html
<RouterView v-slot="{ Component }">
  <KeepAlive>
    <component :is="Component" />
  </KeepAlive>
</RouterView>
```
