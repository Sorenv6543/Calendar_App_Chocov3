# Improving the fetchEvents Function (2025-04-25 05:30:06)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
'isEventModalVisible' is declared but its value is never read.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you fix this issue. Looking at the code, `isEventModalVisible` is declared but never used in the component.

---

```diff
  // Define refs
  const userStore = useUserStore();
- const isEventModalVisible = ref<boolean>(false);
  const isEditMode = ref<boolean>(false);
  const selectedEventId = ref<string | null>(null);
```

---

The issue has been resolved by removing the unused `isEventModalVisible` ref variable. This was declared on line 56 but was never used elsewhere in the component, which caused the linting error.
